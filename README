git-rollback
============

This git extension allows you to undo local and remote commits. 

How to use:

Just drop the 'git-rollback' file into your path, and git will find it. 

You'll be able to use it by typing 'git rollback [options]' just like other git commands. 

To edit your PATH (on Mac OS X):

Open your .profile file, and add:

export PATH=/path/you'd/like/to/place/this/bash/script/in/:$PATH

For more information on how to use the command itself, see documentation on github.

------------

If you prefer a python script, use the file ending with .py. Rename to remove the .py

extension, and follow the same steps above. You must have python installed on your machine.
